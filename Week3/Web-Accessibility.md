# Web Accessibility

Web accessibility is about making the web accessible for everyone, not just disabled people. A more accessible internet is a better experience for all users and is not enough of a priority yet! People who experience difficulties using the internet don't always have disabilities in the traditional sense, some times it is temporary, like for example if someone breaks their arm and only has use of one, or is a new parent and has to hold their child with one arm. Barriers to usage come in all forms and affect a huge number of people across the globe!  
Disability !== Personal health condition  
Disability === Mismatched human interactions  

## Vision

* ALWAYS use an alt tag for pictures as they are read out by their file name by a screen reader, you can just use an empty one but **make sure** you have one so people aren't having long, meaningless file names read out to them!
* Use high contrast for people with colour-blindness
* With red and green buttons, use text on them as well as this may appear the same to some users
* Use big, clear, easy to read fonts!
* Add a 'skip to main content' option so people don't have to listen through all the header items, this is long, boring and time consuming for anyone using a screen reader!
* Make scrolling bars complimentary so people can skip over them, on LookFantastic.com you have to scroll through every single brand on the left hand side of the page before you can access the main content
* Use announcers to alert the user when a pop-up appears on the page, otherwise visually impaired users won't know it is there and won't be able to do anything further on the page as they are now navigating around the page behind the pop up but can't do anything while the pop up is there!
* Shift focus to pop-ups automatically, otherwise users get stuck behind it

## Other barriers people might encounter

* **Hearing** - use closed captions on videos
* **Motor** - some users can only move a screen by tapping left and right with say their head so any page you create should be accessible to someone tabbing through it item by item. You can easily check this yourself by tabbing through your page and checking it works well
* **Cognitive** - is your site simple, intuitive and easy to use? It should be easy to use if say an old person tries to use it with little understanding and experience of using the internet.
* **Seizures** and Motion Sensitivity - do not put unnecessary videos and/or flashing on your site, this could trigger seizures in many people or simply make people feel nautious, particularly elderly folks who aren't used to things like gifs! If you do include flashing images make sure you include a warning to those who suffer from motion sensitivity and/or seizures.
* **Urgency** - is your site easy to use for someone in a stressful/rushed situation? It should be intuitive and not filled with unnecessary extra elements!

## Business side of things
* **More customers** - the more accessible the website the more people will use it and have a good expereince doing so. Dominoes got sued recently by a blind user who couldn't change his toppings, this was a negative experience for this user and you want to avoid that at all costs.
* **Legislation** - all websites have to be accessible according to the law - this is made clear but not enforced too heavily - at the moment! You could be sued by any user who can't access your site in the way they should be able to, the government could crack down on this at any time and it is not a good thing to get caught in the middle of!
* **Corporate social responsibility** - it's the right thing to do! There should be no reason that someone who is experiencing permanent temporary or situational barriers to usage of the internet should suffer through thoughtlessly designed websites, it is a huge number of people who experience this and it is not a difficult problem to solve, people just need to prioritize it more and think about ALL users, not just some!

## Tools

* **Google lighthouse** - inspect element, look at contrast ratio, look at background colour and see if you are AA or AAA compliant. AA compliant is good and generally what we aim for, AAA compliant is great but sometimes hard to achieve with many colours other than black on white/white on black.
* **Colourblinding** and **NoCoffee** show you how your web page looks to a colour blind user.
* **VoiceOver** - press Cmd + f5 to hear what a visually impaired user hears if using this tool.
